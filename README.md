# Reunitus videoroom React App Hack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is just a VERY quick prototype of a video room using React and Janus Media Server.

![Example Image](https://github.com/SumitKumar-FrontEndDeveloper/janus/blob/main/janus_video.png)

**Important Note:**
It has been directly merged reusing most of the code from the Janus video room [demo](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/master/html/videoroomtest.js), including jQuery!

Next step will be to refactor it to use React full potential, fix multiple bugs when connecting/reconnecting participants and get rid of jQuery.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Install node dependencies of the project
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
